# Leetcode 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
# Medium 1/14/21

# Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

# A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: digits = "23"
# Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

# Example 2:

# Input: digits = ""
# Output: []

# Example 3:

# Input: digits = "2"
# Output: ["a","b","c"]

 

# Constraints:

#     0 <= digits.length <= 4
#     digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].


# Solution 1 Using backtracking

# Backtracking is an algorithm for finding all solutions by exploring all potential candidates. 
#

        phone = {'2': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
                 '3': ['d', 'e', 'f'],
                 '4': ['g', 'h', 'i'],

                 '7': ['p', 'q', 'r', 's'],
                 '8': ['t', 'u', 'v'],

            # if there is no more digits to check
            if len(next_digits) == 0:
                # the combination is done
                output.append(combination)
            # if there are still digits to check
            else:
                # iterate over all letters which map 
                # the next available digit
                for letter in phone[next_digits[0]]:
                    # append the current letter to the combination
                    # and proceed to the next digits
                    backtrack(combination + letter, next_digits[1:])
                    
        output = []
        if digits:
            backtrack("", digits)
        return output

# Time complexity: O(3^N * 4 ^M) where N is the numbr of digits in the input that maps to 3 letters.

# Space complexity: O(3^N * 4 ^M) since one has to keep 3^N * 4^M solutions.
