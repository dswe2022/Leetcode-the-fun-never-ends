# Leetcode 126. Word Ladder II
# Hard 1/25/21 

# Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:

# Only one letter can be changed at a time
# Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
# Note:

# Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
# All words have the same length.
# All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
# You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
# You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
# Example 1:

# Input:
# beginWord = "hit",
# endWord = "cog",
# wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

# Output:
# [
#   ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
#   ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
# ]
# Example 2:

# Input:
# beginWord = "hit"
# endWord = "cog"
# wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

# Output: []

# Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

        To let successful exploration by level, we need visited and visitedAtThisLevel sets.
        Append newly found words to visitedAtThisLevel, and not in visited since for other
        paths in exploration "nextWord" could be the critical word required
        to form the shortest path

        For example in this diagram, if previous items in queue were
        [hit, hot] and [hit, lit], then in the next level iteration if we mark
        "lot" as visited when coming from [hit, hot], then "lot" will
        no longer be visible to [hit, lit]. So it is important that we let
        other nodes at the same level still "explore" a visited node. After
        the level exploration is finished thÂ¨en we can mark the nodes
        dot, lot and lor together as visited.
